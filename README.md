# FluSight Forecasts (Hubverse Version)

This repo contains the origina FluSight Forecast submissions (<https://github.com/cdcepi/FluSight-forecasts>), reformatted to align with the hubverse format. For further detailed information on the original submissions and the content/format of the original files, refer to the repository above.

## Original Submissions

Submissions were submitted by modeling teams and organized within season by the name or number of the submitting team; within each team-specific or model-specific folder, a series of .csv submissions were stored, with file names typically (but not always) in the format: \"EWXX-TeamXX-YYYY-MM-DD.csv\", where

-   **EWXX** is the latest MMWR week of data used in the forecast

-   **TeamXX** is the team name/number

-   **YYYY-MM-DD** is the date of forecast submission

There were four types of targets related to influenza-like illness: season onset, peak week, peak percentage, and week ahead forecasts (1, 2, 3, and weeks) of weighted ILINet percentage
